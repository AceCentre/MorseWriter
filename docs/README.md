# What is MorseWriter?

MorseWriter is a system tray application that interprets one or two key presses in a Morse code pattern and converts them into key equivalents. This allows users with good timing to access and control their entire computer using one, two, three keys or switches. You can emulate the full computer keyboard and mouse. There is also a typing mode which has word predictions.
