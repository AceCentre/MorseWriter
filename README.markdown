*MorseWriter*

This is a small system tray app designed in Python to interpret one or two key presses pressed in a set way (morse) and convert them to the key equivalent. This should mean that a user who has good timing can access the entire computer and write. 

**Usage**
- Run the MorseWriter.exe 
- Select your options
- Note the two key option: the key on the left hand pull down menu relates to dit (*) and one on the right relates to dah (-)
- Set your sounds
- Press go
- Minimise the black debug window. NB: If you close it you are closing the app. 
- Note that all normal key entry is now disabled. To halt the script use a mouse to navigate to the system tray icon and quit the app

**Issues:**
- Debug window needs to be minimised even if debug switched off
- If you set to two key mode you need to be careful not to set both keys as input
- 1 & 2 input keys relate to the keys above the letters on the keyboard - not a numeric keypad
- Sounds can't be edited - these are from the system folder
